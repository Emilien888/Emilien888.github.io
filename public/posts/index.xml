      <description>ðŸ‘‹ Hi again! This is part 5 of my devlog where I code my multiplayer turn-based strategy game. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I made a devlog, so there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit to unpack here. Priorities have changed for the better, gameplay mechanics have been established, a community chat has been created, and an artist has joined forces with me to create the game! There&amp;rsquo;s been quite a bit of progress made in the code as well.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to the fourth part of my devlog where I develop my multiplayer turn-based game. I previously didn&amp;rsquo;t have a name, but I have decided to name it 8bit Duels! I think this fits the theme pretty nicely. Anyways, on with the devlog!
Refactoring This devlog is all about refactoring, and how I made my code cleaner. I did this by creating a workspace shared between the client and the server.</description>

      <description>Hello readers! This is my progress for week 2 of coding my multiplayer game with Rust and Bevy. This post is a bit late, and shouldâ€™ve been out yesterday, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to make it in time. Anyways, here is my progress this week.

In this post, we will cover three things:</description>
