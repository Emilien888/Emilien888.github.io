This is a short post introducing my first blog series, where I will document my process creating a multiplayer turn-based game.

This includes the programming language and the game engine as well as how the game will work. I will also cover the code editor Iâ€™m using.\nMy schedule: Iâ€™ll explain briefly what my expectations are regarding post frequency.\nThe content. Iâ€™ll detail what my posts will include.\nWithout any further ado, letâ€™s get started!\nWhat Iâ€™m making Iâ€™m making a multiplayer turn-based game. The game is inspired by chess, because you will be able to move your troops across the board, but it is more heavily inspired by Clash Mini, a game from Supercell (link to the clash website). With this project, I aim to learn more about game development. I also hope to discover the wonderful (or rather awful) world of networking and all the bugs that will come with it. There is no deadline for the game, as progress is very slow and inconsistent. In the end, I hope to make the code open source, depending on how proud of it I am ðŸ˜….\nWhat Iâ€™m using Iâ€™m using Rust for this project, along with the Bevy game engine (an amazing open source ECS game engine that you can find here). I am currently coding a server from scratch using, you guessed it, Rust. Currently, there is only one server for all the clients, but this game is more of a proof-of-concept than a game I consider will actually get a player base. However, things are subject to change in the future. To edit code, I use Vim (which Iâ€™ve just started using but already adore) with Rust-Analyzer and coc.nvim, which are a must for Rust development.\nMy schedule As mentioned before, progress on the game is very slow, as it is only a side project and is not on my list of priorities. I do plan on making a post per week regarding the game, though this is subject to change. These posts will come during the weekend, but the schedule is subject to change and I may of course miss some weekly posts. This is more of a way to document my game development experience instead of a serious content series. However, I will appreciate any comments and interaction if you, the reader, is interested.\nMy content In my weekly posts, I plan to cover my weekly progress on my game, as well as a dive into some of the code. I will also show small sneak peaks in the form of images or videos. Finally, I will try to include a programming related meme that I made in each of my posts. I usually also post these on Reddit here. This is this postâ€™s one: That about wraps up my first ever blog post!
