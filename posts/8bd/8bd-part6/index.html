I had to rewrite the code for ownership indicators for the animations to work correctly. The method I was using before was very dumb: I assigned ownership indicators to troops every frame, and that lead to some bizarre bugs.

I wasnâ€™t able to get normal videos to work, so I stuck with this. If anyone know how to add an MP4 video to Hugo, please send me a message.\nAttack Animations These are the new attack animations:\nIn-Game Chat Feature The game now has a chat in game! This means you may discuss with your opponent while player. Usernames are also coming soon (although they will just be local, there is no account system yet).\nSettings Menu Here is the new settings menu:\nThe server address is the only working setting at the moment though.

You can test the game locally by downloading the code (Github).
